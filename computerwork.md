# How computer works

## Introducing How Computers Work:
 > A computer works by combining input, storage, processing, and output. All the main parts of a computer system are involved in one of these four processes. 
What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
 A computer is a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer are: It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).

## Binary & Data:
> Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data, A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data in computing, Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits).
Circuits and Logic:
Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate, Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could accomplish with just a single gate.
## CPU, Memory, Input & Output:
> CPU (pronounced as separate letters) is the abbreviation for central processing unit, Computer memory is any physical device capable of storing information temporarily, like RAM (random access memory), Any information that is processed by and sent out from a computer or other electronic device is considered output, meaning of input is to provide or give something to the computer, in other words, when a computer or device is receiving a command or signal from outer sources.
## Hardware and Software:
> Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of code installed onto your computer's hard drive
