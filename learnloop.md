* less than or equal (<=)
* logical operators:
* logical and (&&)
* logical not (!)
# Loops:
Used for check the condition if true or false and depend on it will specified the number of repeating the code 
## Types of Loops :
* For loop :
* For (var i=0;i<20,i++){
* Document.write(i);}
* While loop :
* While(i<10 (the condition)) {
* // the code
* i++;}
* Do while
* do{
* //the code
* } while(the condition);
> Note : you should pay attention about the condition to not make it results in an infinite loop in the code execution.
