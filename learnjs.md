# JavaScript

Why do we need JavaScript?

 Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

First HTML is the CONTENT LAYER, that gives the page structure and adds semantics.

 Secondly CSS PRESENTATION LAYER, that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box
dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

 Finally, JavaScript is a behavior layer, that can change how the page behaves, adding
Interactivity
These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.
 
SO, JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.


## How to write or add JAVASCRIPT?
 JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not
need any new tools to write a script.

## LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE:
 When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored, all that without affecting the source HTML code.

> Note:  You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files), but it is better to put JavaScript file should be Kept separated, so that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. Plus, you can also reuse the code on several pages.

JAVASCRIPT RUNS WHEREIT IS FOUND IN THE HTML

 When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.

## STATEMENTS:
 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.

Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement, which should end with a semicolon.

*Note: JavaScript is case sensitive, so you need to be careful when writing it capital and small letters, also, some statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as code blocks. The closing curly
brace is not followed by a semicolon. 

## COMMENTS:
 Comments make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
 It could be single-line (//) or multi-line (/* ……*/) comments.

## Variables:
 A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
 
> Declare a Variable:
Variable keyword(var) + variable name + semicolon (;)
Could be numeric or string or Boolean.
