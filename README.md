> About “growth mindset” in my opinion this method talk about how you can change your principles and opnions and how you change in in an effectevnise way to stop thinking about what you can not do due to your situation or the challengies you faced it.

**My our three point that I always put it in my mind to keep yourself in a growth mindset.**

* First one I always try to make my best and use the hard working in what ever I do.
* second I used to put my self in a challenging environment.
* third I always try to learn from people who had a huge science and experience and make it inspire.
